<div> <h2 style="padding-left: 10px;"> History of Tourism </h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 10px;">

The tourism business is at least 2,000 years old. It began when wealthy citizens of ancient Rome, deciding they <br>

would rather spend their summers away from the city, took trips to the countryside and the coast. <br>

A tourist industry soon sprang up to cater for the Romans' travel and accommodation needs, and for <br>

a while it thrived. But Roman tourism ended with its empire, and for hundreds of years the turbulent <br>

economic, social and military situation in Europe made frequent, safe travel out of the question. <br>

During the medieval era, however, tourism again appeared thanks to a growing interest in pilgrimages. <br>

The organisers arranged the tourism basics of itineraries and places to eat and sleep. And from records <br>

such as Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, it's evident that many pilgrims were keen to relax and enjoy themselves <br>

as well as visit a holy shrine. In fact it’s from the Old English word hāligdæg (holy day) that “holiday” derives.
